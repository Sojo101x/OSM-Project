# OSM-Project

This project's goal is to develop a navigation system using
Open Street Map data that helps users navigate buildings
on Northwestern University's campus. The Project is designed
in C++.

This Project reads xmldocs and creates a WU Graph. The document
within the files is one that stores information on buildings at
Northwestern. Ultimately, the program builds a graph of the
Northwestern University campus from the nodes and footways, 
and use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to navigate between buildings.
